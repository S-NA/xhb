X Haskell Bindings

The goal of this project is to provide a Haskell library for interacting
with an X server, using XCB as a model.

The bedrock of the library will be datatypes and serialization code
automatically generated from the 'xproto' XML files:

To see what the current progress is, try the following:

  chmod +x generate.sh
  ./generate.sh

and then look around in the "generated" directory.
