X Haskell Bindings
------------------

The goal of this project is to provide a Haskell library for interacting
with an X server, using XCB as a model.

The bedrock of the library will be datatypes and serialization code
automatically generated from the 'xproto' XML files:

To see what the current progress is, try the following:

  chmod +x generate.sh
  ./generate.sh

and then look around in the "patched" directory.


How To Hack
----------

There are three bash scripts that live in the top-level of this project:

./generate.sh

  This file generates Haskell source from the X Protocol XML description into
  the directory "generated".

  If the file "./patch" is found, it is used to patch the generated files.
  The result of patching is placed into the directory "patched".

./makepatch.sh

  The difference between the "generated" directory and "working" directory
  is saved into the file "patch".  The script "./generate.sh" is then called.

./parse.sh

  The XML files are parsed and then pretty-printed to a human-readable form
  into the directory "parsed".

  The intent is that the results of parsing can be isolated from the results
  of code generation to make finding bugs easier.
